This file is in UTF-8 encoding.

To use unicode utility, you need: 
 - python >=2.6 (str format() method is needed), preferrably wide
   unicode build, however, python3 is recommended
 - python optparse library (part of since python2.3)
 - UnicodeData.txt file (http://www.unicode.org/Public) which
   you should put into /usr/share/unicode/, ~/.unicode/ or current working directory.
 - if you want to see UniHan properties, you need also Unihan.txt file
   which should be put into /usr/share/unicode/, ~./unicode/ or current working directory.


Enter regular expression, hexadecimal number or some characters as an
argument. unicode will try to guess what you want to look up, see the
manpage if you want to force other behaviour (the manpage is also the
best documentation). In particular, -r forces searching for regular
expression in the names of character, -s forces unicode to display 
information about the characters given.

Here are just some examples how to use this script:

$ unicode.py euro
U+20A0 EURO-CURRENCY SIGN
UTF-8: e2 82 a0   UTF-16BE: 20a0   Decimal: &#8352;
₠
Category: Sc (Symbol, Currency)
Bidi: ET (European Number Terminator)

U+20AC EURO SIGN
UTF-8: e2 82 ac   UTF-16BE: 20ac   Decimal: &#8364;
€
Category: Sc (Symbol, Currency)
Bidi: ET (European Number Terminator)

$ unicode.py 00c0
U+00C0 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH GRAVE
UTF-8: c3 80   UTF-16BE: 00c0   Decimal: &#192;
À (à)
Lowercase: U+00E0
Category: Lu (Letter, Uppercase)
Bidi: L (Left-to-Right)
Decomposition: 0041 0300



You can specify a range of characters as argumets, unicode will show
these characters in nice tabular format, aligned to 256-byte boundaries.  
Use two dots ".." to indicate the range, e.g.

       unicode 0450..0520

will display the whole cyrillic, armenian and hebrew blocks (characters from U+0400 to U+05FF)

       unicode 0400..

will display just characters from U+0400 up to U+04FF

Use --fromcp to query codepoints from other encodings:

$ unicode --fromcp cp1250 -d 200
U+010C LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CARON
UTF-8: c4 8c  UTF-16BE: 010c  Decimal: &#268;
Č (Č)
Uppercase: U+010C
Category: Lu (Letter, Uppercase)
Bidi: L (Left-to-Right)
Decomposition: 0043 030C

Multibyte encodings are supported:
$ unicode --fromcp big5 -x aff3

and multi-char strings are supported, too:

$ unicode --fromcp utf-8 -x c599c3adc5a5
